# Image Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Code Overview
### Image Loading Function
Two image loading functions, load_images_from_directory2 and load_images_from_directory, are provided to load images from specified directories. These functions read image files (in JPG or PNG format) and convert them into a format suitable for SVM classification. The images are resized to 64x64 pixels, and pixel values are flattened for further processing.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
The code then loads images of dogs and cats from training and testing directories using the defined functions. The training dataset is constructed by stacking images of dogs and cats vertically, and corresponding labels (0 for dogs, 1 for cats) are created. The pixel values are standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

### SVM Model Training
An SVM classifier with a polynomial kernel (kernel='poly') and a regularization parameter (C=0.1) is trained on the preprocessed training data. The SVM model aims to learn patterns that distinguish between dogs and cats based on the provided images.

### Model Evaluation
The trained SVM classifier is then evaluated on a larger test dataset. Predictions are made on the test set, and the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are calculated to assess the model's performance.

### Running the Code
To use this code for your dataset, you need to replace the directory paths with the paths to your own training and testing datasets. Additionally, you can experiment with different SVM parameters, such as the kernel type ('linear', 'poly', 'rbf', etc.) and the regularization parameter C, to optimize the model for your specific dataset.

## Understanding Low Accuracy in Image Classification with SVM
The obtained accuracy of 0.5 indicates that the SVM model is performing no better than random guessing on your dataset. Several factors could contribute to this low accuracy, and investigating these aspects can help identify the root causes.

`1. Data Quality`
- Labeling Consistency: Ensure that the images are correctly labeled. Mislabeling can confuse the model.
Dataset Representativeness: Verify that your dataset is representative of the problem. A small or unbalanced dataset may hinder the model's ability to generalize.

`2. Data Split`
- Confirm that the data splitting into training and testing sets is done correctly. Use stratified splitting to maintain class distribution in both sets.

`3. Model Complexity`
- The choice of SVM kernel and hyperparameters like C can significantly impact performance. Experiment with different kernels ('linear', 'poly', 'rbf') and adjust hyperparameters for optimal results.
 # On Going Challenges in Solving Image Classification Issue
 Despite ongoing efforts, the issue of low accuracy in image classification persists. Several challenges contribute to the complexity of addressing this problem. This document outlines some of the key challenges faced in resolving the issue.

 ## `Key Challenges`

`1. Large Dataset Size`
- The dataset size is substantial, making it challenging to analyze and process the entire dataset thoroughly. This large dataset introduces computational complexities and resource constraints.

`2. Limited Processing Resources`
- The available computational resources may be insufficient to handle the demands of training on a large dataset. This limitation can impede the exploration of alternative models and hyperparameters.

`3. Uncertain Cause of Low Accuracy`
- The exact cause of the low accuracy remains unclear. It may stem from a combination of factors such as data quality, model complexity, or suboptimal hyperparameters.

The challenge of low accuracy in image classification is a complex problem compounded by the dataset's size and computational limitations. Despite the current lack of a definitive solution, the outlined steps forward aim to provide a path for incremental progress and exploration. Continued experimentation, collaboration, and optimization efforts may eventually lead to insights that contribute to the resolution of the accuracy issue.
